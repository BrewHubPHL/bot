The code is then executed, potentially granting the user system access to export sensitive data, to install malware, or even to move laterally and to exploit other systems in the trusted internal network environment. While code injection attacks can take place in several ways, the common factor is allowing the user to submit executable code to the application. The most common forms of code injection are SQL injection (server side) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (client side).\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Apply least privilege principle (for example, limit users to read only wherever possible).\n- Avoid passing raw user input directly to functions; use parameterized queries to extract data first.\n- Sanitize user input strings of special characters such as ?, &, /, <, >, and quotation marks.\n- Use whitelisting of known good values.\n- Validate user input against expected response types.\n- Escape shell commands with functions such as shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg for PHP.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities so these cannot be exploited by code injection.\n- Educate all team members on safe data handling procedures to prevent attacks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","CodeInjection","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpParam","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/lvn/botstrap/commit/aafeaca53e8d89eb950d8e9c3af8874dc90686ec?diff=split#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L-1","lines": [{"line": "var config = require(configFile);\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configFile));\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload/commit/5de61299a0a7aa602fe015ac9f2ff3af3f798348?diff=split#diff-8f9d1530fa118465c523a517c5f4cac4ec173f17b820514034dc39e588415f63L-1","lines": [{"line": "var update = event.data;\r\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "new Function(update)();\r\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var data = event.data ?

The payload may be delivered by the server or other channels, butΓÇöunlike reflected or stored XSSΓÇöthe server does not perform the injection/echo that triggers execution; the critical issue is a tainted data flow from source to sink within client-side logic, which traditional server-side defenses and many WAFs often miss.\n\nEffective mitigation of DOM XSS vulnerabilities requires implementing comprehensive input validation and output encoding strategies specifically designed for clientΓÇæside execution contexts. This includes establishing strict allowlisting mechanisms for userΓÇæcontrollable data, implementing contextΓÇæaware output encoding based on the specific DOM operation being performed, and adopting secure coding practices that minimize the attack surface exposed through dangerous DOM/JavaScript APIs. Additionally, modern web applications should leverage Content Security Policy (CSP) directives and other browser security features to establish defenseΓÇæinΓÇædepth protections against DOMΓÇæbased attacks.\n\nDOM XSS attacks have been extensively documented in security research and are frequently exploited to achieve various malicious objectives, including session hijacking through cookie theft, credential harvesting via phishing attacks, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users, clientΓÇæside malware distribution, and sensitive data exfiltration. The clientΓÇæside nature of these attacks makes them effective at bypassing traditional perimeter security controls and targeting users directly within their browser environment.\n\n### Types of attacks\n\n| Type                         | Source Category          | Description                                                                                                                                         | Technical Details                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **URL Parameter Injection**  | Navigation               | Malicious payloads embedded within URL query parameters that are processed by vulnerable JavaScript code accessing `location.search` or similar properties. | Commonly exploits `URLSearchParams`, direct string parsing, or framework routing mechanisms that unsafely process query parameters (including History API updates like `pushState`). |\n| **Fragment Identifier Exploitation** | Navigation       | Attack vectors utilizing URL hash fragments (`#`) that are accessible through `location.hash` and processed by clientΓÇæside routing or content loading mechanisms. | Particularly prevalent in Single Page Applications (SPAs) with clientΓÇæside routing frameworks that process hashΓÇæbased navigation.                                                       |\n| **HTTP Referrer Manipulation** | Request Context       | Exploitation of `document.referrer` values that contain malicious payloads, typically originating from attackerΓÇæcontrolled websites linking to the vulnerable application. | Requires social engineering to direct users from attackerΓÇæcontrolled domains with crafted referrer values.                                                                            |\n| **Browser Storage Attacks**  | Persistent Storage       | Malicious data injection into `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or IndexedDB that is subsequently read and processed unsafely by application JavaScript.    | Can persist across sessions if the attacker can get data stored (via another bug or social engineering) and may be combined with other vectors for staged exploitation.               |\n| **Cross-Frame Communication** | Inter-Frame Messaging   | Exploitation of `postMessage` APIs where malicious data is transmitted between frames or windows and processed without proper origin validation and input sanitization. | Common in applications with embedded iframes or popup windows that implement crossΓÇæorigin communication mechanisms.                                                                    |\n| **WebSocket Message Injection** | Real-time Communication | Malicious payloads delivered through WebSocket connections that are processed by clientΓÇæside message handlers without adequate input validation.         | Particularly effective against realΓÇætime applications like chat systems, collaborative tools, or live data feeds.                                                                       |\n\n### Affected environments\n\nDOM XSS vulnerabilities can impact various categories of web applications and clientΓÇæside environments:\n\n- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** utilizing frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or custom JavaScript implementations\n- **Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)** with extensive clientΓÇæside functionality and offline capabilities\n- **ClientΓÇæside routing implementations** including hashΓÇæbased and HTML5 History API routing mechanisms\n- **Browser extensions and addΓÇæons** with content script injection and web page interaction capabilities\n- **Hybrid mobile applications** utilizing WebView components and JavaScript bridge implementations\n- **Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)** with complex clientΓÇæside business logic and DOM manipulation\n- **Content Management Systems (CMS)** with client-side editing interfaces and dynamic content rendering\n- **Social media platforms and widgets** implementing clientΓÇæside content embedding and sharing functionality\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\nThis section outlines comprehensive security measures designed to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities through secure development practices and technical controls.\n\n### Input Validation and Sanitization\n\n- **Implement strict input validation** for all clientΓÇæside data sources including URL parameters, fragment identifiers, referrer values, storage mechanisms, and crossΓÇæframe communications using allowlisting approaches rather than blacklisting methodologies.\n- **Establish contextual output encoding** appropriate for the specific DOM context where data will be utilized, including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript string escaping, CSS value encoding, and URL parameter encoding.\n- **Validate data origin and integrity** for crossΓÇæframe `postMessage` communications by implementing strict origin checking and message format validation to prevent malicious data injection from untrusted sources.\n- **Sanitize persistent storage data** by validating all data retrieved from `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or other clientΓÇæside storage mechanisms before processing or rendering within the application.\n\n### Secure DOM Manipulation Practices\n\n- **Avoid highΓÇærisk DOM sinks** including `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write()`, `document.writeln()`, `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with string arguments when processing userΓÇæcontrollable data.\n- **Utilize safer DOM manipulation methods** such as `textContent`, `createTextNode()`, and DOM element creation APIs that do not interpret content as executable code. Use `setAttribute()` only for nonΓÇæURL/nonΓÇæevent attributes and never to set `on*` handlers or dangerous URL attributes from untrusted data.\n- **Implement secure templating mechanisms** using frameworks or libraries that provide automatic output encoding and XSS protection rather than manual string concatenation for dynamic content generation.\n- **Enforce separation of data and code** by avoiding the construction of JavaScript code through string concatenation with userΓÇæcontrollable data and utilizing structured data formats like JSON for data transmission.\n\n### Browser Security Feature Implementation\n\n- **Deploy comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP)** directives (e.g., `script-src`, `object-src`, `base-uri`, `frame-ancestors`) to limit script execution and reduce impact if a DOM XSS exists.\n- **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)** for all external JavaScript resources to prevent tampering with thirdΓÇæparty libraries that could introduce DOM XSS vulnerabilities.\n- **Utilize HTTP security headers** including `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (if CSP is not available) `X-Frame-Options`, while preferring CSPΓÇÖs `frame-ancestors` directive for clickjacking protection.\n- **Adopt modern browser defenses** such as Trusted Types (where supported) to prevent assignment to DOM sinks unless passed through an approved sanitizer. Treat CORS as an access-control mechanismΓÇönot a DOM XSS controlΓÇöand configure it appropriately to limit unnecessary cross-origin data exposure.\n\n### Development and Testing Practices\n\n- **Conduct regular security code reviews** focusing specifically on client-side data flow analysis to identify potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities during the development process.\n- **Implement automated static analysis** using specialized tools capable of detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript code and identifying unsafe data flows from sources to sinks.\n- **Perform dynamic application security testing (DAST)** with specialized DOM XSS detection capabilities and manual penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.\n- **Establish secure coding guidelines** for development teams including training on DOM XSS attack vectors, secure JavaScript programming practices, and proper use of securityΓÇæfocused libraries and frameworks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","DOMXSS","Security","SourceNonServer","SourceResourceAccess","SourceFile","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/codice/ddf/commit/a8c54db08a09e8104443fd8531c0f8b6cffda1c7?diff=split#diff-e3bb069f9efbc30d0207a7c690710bc5a3b2acac15a5b8425e622a88e63a41cdL-1","lines": [{"line": "$('#extramessage').html(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' ')));\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "$('#extramessage').text(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' '))).html();\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Drive4ik/simple-tab-groups/commit/d23caa02378845671eb32ee2c43c368f857b47c3?diff=split#diff-efdba41d528998f946ce1103fa57532e3746b2e9b1984cb92c94a2526451aedbL-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerHTML = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerText = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mykter/TagTime-desktop/commit/684351457a3299047fa60563785aa1716df00888?diff=split#diff-821c318e2a22a1360159993ee2168341f78e7567d0b1c9996a76f3e0cfb27b26L-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").innerHTML =\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").textContent = moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 227,"cwe": ["CWE-79"]}},{"id": "javascript/HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","name": "HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Hardcoded Non-Cryptographic Secret"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nWhen constants are hardcoded into applications, this information could easily be reverse-engineered and become known to attackers.
